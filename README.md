# NexelArena

**NexelArena** is an **very fast**, fully **asynchronous arena regenerator**.

> ⚠ **Heavily Experimental** — This project is heavily experimental, and as of now, the memory consumption is alot (around 1 gb for 10 million blocks,) and, is not living up to expectations (such as being 2x slower than FAWE).

> ⚠ **PaperMC ONLY** — This will **NOT** work on Spigot or non-Paper forks!
